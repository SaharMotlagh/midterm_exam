# Midterm!
## Group :
Proposition: Sahar Mahmoudimotlagh
	Dogs are better.
Opposition: Aixin Zhong
	Cats are better.
## Assignment Description:

Work with ONE other person as a team, or alternatively work on your own with 2 github accounts (if you have them). 

Create a Github repo with a ReadMe file; add your partner as a collaborator.

You will be building a 1-page app. Pick a subject that you can disagree about - both points of view should appear in the final submission. As an example, one person could argue that dogs are best, the other person could argue that in fact cats are WAY better than dogs.

Create a simple page with images and text. Divide the page into two sections, using the SECTION element. The first section is arguing FOR, the second is arguing AGAINST. Each team member will use one of the section elements to express their point of view.

Create a conflict with your teammate before you get too far into the assignment; resolve it. Take a screenshot of the conflict details and submit that wth your repo.

Make sure you merge everything to master and submit the link.
